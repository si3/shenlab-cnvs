# This script will reformat target BED file to a CLAMMS windows BED file
# Large intervals will be broken down into ~500bp windows
# Script needs the following files, do not use "." in identifier:

# $1 variable - (required) path to BED file with targets (TgtFil)
# $2 variable - (required) path to REF shell file (RefFil)

# Script needs to be in COV_DIR (same intended directory as output from bedtools)
# Information imported from RefFil include the following:

# Mappability.bed 
# CLAMMS special regions
# Insert size
# Reference fasta

# Information about mappability and sequence complexity will be included in windows.bed
# All files need to have matching chormosome names and order (no "chr")
# Sort them with bedtools sort prior to running script

#	- mappability from UCSC wig file with appropriate read length (mappability.bed)
# 	- reference fasta (genome.fa)
#	- CLAMMS special regions (clamms_special_regions.bed)
#	- insert size

# Will also be included as metadata. Sort all bed files with bedtools sort or sort -k1,1 -k2,2n
# chmod +x any CLAMMS scripts
# Run this for each capture kit separately
